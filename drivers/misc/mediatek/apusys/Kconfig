config MTK_APUSYS_SUPPORT
	tristate "MediaTek APUSYS driver"
	default n
	help
	  Support Mediatek APUSYS features
	  APUSYS is the central control module for
	  QoS, power, profile, scheduler and
	  all AI-related hardware

config MTK_APUSYS_MDLA_SUPPORT
	bool "MDLA driver"
	help
	  Support deep neural network calculation using
	  hardware accelerator. Customers and third party
	  could use MDLA to develop feature and algorithm
	  by themselves.

config MTK_APUSYS_VPU
	bool "VPU driver"
	select REMOTEPROC
	help
	  Support image processing using VPU hardware.
	  Customers and third party could use VPU to develop
	  feature and algorithm by themselves. There is better
	  performance and power if image process algorithm
	  land on VPU instead of CPU/GPU.

config MTK_APUSYS_VPU_DEBUG
	bool "VPU Debug"
	depends on MTK_APUSYS_VPU
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	help
	  Enable debug facilities of VPU, such as
	  kernel logs, register dumps, device logs,
	  VPU jtag functions, and MET trace.
	  Disable, if you don't need them.

config MTK_APUSYS_EDMA_SUPPORT
	bool "EDMA (External DMA) Driver"
	help
	  The purpose of Mediatek eDMA is performing
	  data transfer between external memory such as
	  DRAM/TCM, It will cooperate with MDLA. eDMA
	  support different modes for image process.
